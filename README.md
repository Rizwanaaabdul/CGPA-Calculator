CGPA Calculator

This is a CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) calculator developed in C++. I have made this project for my college use, based on my deparment courses, credit and grade points. It is helpful for students to calculate their cgpa for each sem or their cumulative cgpa as well. We have 24 credits for even sem and 23 credits for odd sem. The calculator provides a simple command line interface for inputting credits and grades. The calculator determines the category classification based on the calculated CGPA, such as First Class with Distinction, First Class, etc.
